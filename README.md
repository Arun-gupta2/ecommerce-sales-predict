# Predict Sales BigMart

## Overview
This project aims to predict sales for BigMart outlets using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, the model forecasts future sales, assisting in inventory management and strategic planning.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering on the BigMart sales dataset.
- Implementation of various regression models to predict sales.
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Visualization of data insights and model predictions.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [BigMart Sales Dataset](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/)
- **Description:** The dataset contains sales data for 1,559 products across 10 stores. It includes attributes like item identifier, item weight, item visibility, item type, outlet identifier, outlet establishment year, outlet size, outlet location type, outlet type, and item outlet sales.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Arun-gupta2/Predict_sales_bigmart.git

## Models Implemented
Linear Regression: A baseline model to understand data relationships.

Decision Tree Regressor: Captures non-linear patterns in the data.

Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method improving prediction accuracy.

XGBoost Regressor: A gradient boosting technique for enhanced performance.

## Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average magnitude of errors.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides error magnitude in the same unit as the target variable.

### Results
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of various regression models in predicting sales. Detailed results and visualizations are available in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Future Enhancements
   -Incorporate additional features to improve model accuracy.

   -Implement hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.

   -Deploy the model as a web application for real-time sales prediction.
